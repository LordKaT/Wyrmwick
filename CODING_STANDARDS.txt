Coding practices for Wyrmwick:

Use TAB not spaces. Everyone loves spaces. Everyone loves using a different
number of spaces. I don't like this. Use TAB, set your editor to the number of
spaces per TAB that you like. One TAB per indentation.

Code should be short and legible. If you can't read code like a book, then you
either don't comment enough, or you're out-thinking yourself and making a damned
mess of your code.

Always use {} when available. Lends to readability.

Keep opening curly bracketys { on the same line as the statement it's opening.

Comment as needed. Not every function should require an opening monologue about
what it does and how it does it - your code should explain that.

Algorithms should be commented, explaining what they do. How is optional, unless
you are using a non-standard algorithm that can't be looked up on a wiki easily.
We don't need paragraphs of comments explaining bubble sort.

Use /* */ or // for comments. I don't care.

Keep globals to a minimum. There's usually another way to use them. If you must
keep ALL globals in globals.cpp. Yes, even those shitty ones you use in one or
two functions. It's my way of enforcing a limit on global variables.

extern your globals in globals.h
