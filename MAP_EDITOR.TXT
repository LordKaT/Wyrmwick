Map editor is very basic.

There are very little signals that something is happneing. I am a terrible
UI designer. You'll have to take it on faith that things are working right.

In most modes you will simply use the keyboard to type in what you want.

When in doubt, the bottom-left of the screen will tell you what mode you're in.

Press ESCAPE to return to edit mode at any time. 


The following must be pressed from within EDIT mode.

F1 = Rename map

F2 = not finished/does nothing (Future: Choose new tile from sprite sheet)
F3 = not finished/does nothing (Future: Choose new sprite sheet)

F4 = Walk editor (collision detection)
F5 = Save map (to: data/maps/Map Name.map)
F6 = Turn grid on/off 
F7 = not finished/does nothing (Future: LUA script name)
F9 = Load map (from: data/maps/Map Name.map)


When in EDIT mode:

Right or Middle click and drag to move map.
Left/right arrows select new tile.
Left click to place tile.
